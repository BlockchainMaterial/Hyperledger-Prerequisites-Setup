# Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain Prerequisites  

**IBM Cloud Blockchain Platform set up**

- Register for IBM Cloud (free): https://ibm.biz/Bd2YQt 
- Additional info on IBM Blockchain Platform: https://ibm.biz/Bd2Z5w

**Local MacOS set up** 

1. Download cURL latest version. 
- You can do this by installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) by running in your terminal : `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
- Run in CLI `brew install curl`
- Check if you have cURL installed by typing the following in your terminal: `curl -V`. The version should pull up. 
2. Install by clicking on [Docker for MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) or update Docker to latest version if you already have it. It’s easy to do this, just open Docker and it will prompt you to update to latest version.
- Run `docker --version` . Docker version 17.06.2-ce or greater is required.
- Run `docker-compose --version`. Docker Compose version 1.14.0 or greater required. 
3. Download Golang for MacOS [here](https://golang.org/doc/install?download=go1.11.4.darwin-amd64.pkg).
-  Run `go` in your terminal to verify set up. The message “Go is a tool for managing Go source code” should show up. 
- Next run `export GOPATH=$HOME/go`. This sets the environment variable `GOPATH` to point at the Go workspace containing the downloaded Fabric code base. 
- You should (again, in the appropriate startup file) extend your command search path to include the Go `bin` directory. Run `export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin`.
4. Download Node by typing in: `brew install node`. 
- Note: If you already have node, run `brew upgrade node`.
5. Download [Python2](https://hackercodex.com/guide/python-development-environment-on-mac-osx/) `brew install python@2`. 
- Check if you have it installed by running `python --version`. Python 2.7 is required.
6. Download [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
7. Optional: If your build fails, you may need to install XCode. 
- [XCode Installation](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- After installation run in terminal `sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/`
- Update NPM in terminal `npm install -g npm@latest`

2. Download [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
