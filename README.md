# Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain Prerequisites  
**Local MacOS set up** 


1. Download cURL latest version. 
- You can do this by installing \[Homebrew\](https://brew.sh) by running in your terminal : `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
- Type in `brew install curl`
- Check if you have cURL installed by typing the following in your terminal: `curl -V`. The version should pull up. 
2. Install by clicking on \[Docker for MacOS\](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) or update Docker to latest version if you already have it. It’s easy to do this, just open Docker and it will prompt you to update to latest version.
- Run `docker` `**--**``version` . Docker version 17.06.2-ce or greater is required.
- Run `docker``**-**``compose` `**--**``version` . Docker Compose version 1.14.0 or greater required. 
3. Download Golang for MacOS \[here\](https://golang.org/doc/install?download=go1.11.4.darwin-amd64.pkg). 
-  Run `go` in your terminal to verify set up. The message “Go is a tool for managing Go source code” should show up. 
- Next run `export GOPATH=$HOME/go`. This sets the environment variable `GOPATH` to point at the Go workspace containing the downloaded Fabric code base. 
- You should (again, in the appropriate startup file) extend your command search path to include the Go `bin` directory. Finally, run `export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin`.
1. Download Node by typing in: `brew install node`. If you already have node, run `brew upgrade node`
2. Download \[Python2\](https://hackercodex.com/guide/python-development-environment-on-mac-osx/) `brew install python@2` . 
- Check if you have it installed by running `python --version`.  Python 2.7 required.
